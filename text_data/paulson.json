In 1989, 77 percent of households owned life insurance (see figure 1). By 2013, that share\nhad fallen to 60 percent. This article analyzes factors that might have contributed to the decline in life\ninsurance ownership from 1989 to 2013. The focus of our analysis is on two broad sources of potential change\nin the demand for life insurance: changes in the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the\n1\npopulation and changes in how those same characteristics are associated with the decision to purchase life\ninsurance. In addition, we highlight the considerable diversity in life insurance ownership across education,\nincome, and race and ethnicity and describe how trends in life insurance ownership vary across these groups.\nLife insurance protects families from adverse financial consequences when a policyholder dies. In addition,\nsome life insurance policies facilitate tax-advantaged savings. According to a 2015 LIMRA survey (see\ntable 1), the top three reasons for purchasing life insurance are to cover funeral expenses (51 percent), to\nreplace lost income (34 percent), and to cover mortgage debt (26 percent). Transferring wealth to the next\ngeneration is a close fourth, with 24 percent of respondents reporting that this was a major reason for purchasing\nlife insurance.\nWe analyze 1989 and 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data and find substantial differences in\nthe propensity to own life insurance among households with different demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics. One fact that stands out is the high life insurance ownership rates of African American house-\nholds. African American households are more likely to own life insurance than otherwise similar white\nhouseholds. This is in stark contrast to African American ownership of other financial assets, suggesting\nthat there is something special about life insurance. We speculate that one factor may be the important role\nof African American-owned life insurance firms from the early 1920s through the 1960s (Heen, 2009; and\nChapin, 2012). Another possible explanation is that higher mortality rates for African Americans make it\noptimal for more African Americans than whites to choose to own life insurance. However, there is evidence\nthat African Americans, on average, expect to live six years longer than their actuarial life expectancy\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nTABLE 1\nReasons for purchasing life insurance\nMajor reason Minor reason\n( - - - - - - - - - percent - - - - - - - - - )\nTo cover burial and final expenses 51 33\nTo replace lost income 34 24\nTo pay off mortgage 26 17\nTo transfer wealth to next generation 24 34\nTo pay for home care 17 20\nTo supplement retirement income 14 28\nTo pay for estate taxes or create estate liquidity 14 27\nAs tax-advantaged way to save and invest 8 23\nParent or relative bought for me 8 8\nTo provide funds for education 9 14\nFor business purposes 5 10\nTo make a charitable gift 4 11\nSource: Durham, 2015.\nwhile whites’ subjective and actuarial life expectancies are much closer (Mirowsky, 1999). Deepening our\nunderstanding of the high rates of life insurance ownership among African Americans is an important topic\nfor future research.\nWe show that the substantial decline in life insurance ownership, driven by a steep drop in cash value policies\nand a more moderate drop in term policies from 1989 to 2013, is somewhat surprising given trends in\nsocioeconomic and demographic factors. If people in 2013 behaved the same way they did in 1989, life\ninsurance ownership would have increased modestly. Instead, ownership has decreased substantially across\na wide swath of the population. Explanations for the decline in life insurance must lie in factors that influence\n2\nmany households rather than just a few. This means we need to look beyond the socioeconomic and demo-\ngraphic factors that are the focus of our analysis. A decrease in the need for life insurance due to increased\nlife expectancy is likely to be an especially important part of the explanation. In addition, other potential\nfactors include changes in the tax code that make the ability to lower taxes through life insurance less attractive,\nlower interest rates that also reduce incentives to shelter investment gains from taxes, and increases in the\navailability and decreases in the cost of substitutes for the investment component of cash value life insurance.\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief review of related literature.\nThen we describe the data that we use in the analysis, along with broad trends in life insurance ownership\nby education, income, and race. We then investigate the characteristics associated with the demand for life\ninsurance and consider whether changes in those factors explain the decline in life insurance ownership.\nRelated literature\nThere is an extensive theoretical and empirical literature that analyzes the demand for life insurance. Our\nstarting point is the model developed in Lewis (1989), which extends earlier work by Yaari (1965). Lewis\nmodels the demand for life insurance by considering the perspective of potential beneficiaries and their\nneeds in the case of the death of the insured, who is assumed to be the primary wage earner. Fischer (1973)\nalso emphasizes the role of life expectancy in determining the demand for life insurance over the life cycle\nin a model where agents make decisions about savings, consumption, and insurance. Informally, in the\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nframework from Lewis, with actuarially fair prices, the primary wage earner’s life will be insured at a level\nthat ensures that children and a surviving spouse do not suffer financially if the primary wage earner dies\nprematurely. More formally, the demand for life insurance at any given point in time can be expressed as:\n 1 \n 1−lp  δ \n1) (1−lp)F =max  TC−W,0,\nl(1− p)\n  \n \nwhere F is the face value of all insurance written on the primary wage earner’s life, l is the cost of the\ninsurance divided by its actuarial value,1 p is the probability that the primary wage earner dies, δ is a\nmeasure of relative risk aversion, TC is the present value of the consumption of each child and the surviving\nspouse from the current period until the age at which they are assumed to live independently, given their\nprojected life span, in the scenario that the primary wage earner does not die, and W is net household wealth.\nDemand for life insurance, the left-hand side of the equation, is expressed as the face value of life insurance\nminus the expected premiums, in present value terms. The right-hand side of the equation reflects the pri-\nmary motivation to purchase insurance: to provide consumption for states of the world in which wealth is\ninsufficient to maintain the desired (or optimal) level of consumption. Thus, the purchasing decision comes\ndown to comparing the adjusted present value of the consumption of the dependents (TC ) to net household\nwealth (W ), where the adjustment term depends on the probability that the breadwinner dies, the price of\nthe insurance, and the risk aversion of the dependents.2\nThis framework provides some guidance about the factors that might influence the demand for life insurance.\nIn particular, the demand for life insurance will be higher when the probability of death is higher, when\nrisk aversion is higher, and when the present value of beneficiaries’ consumption is higher. The present\nvalue of beneficiaries’ consumption summarizes many factors and is likely to be higher when household\nincome is higher, when children are younger, when the expected educational costs of children are higher,\nwhen there are more children, and when there is a single wage earner in the family. In contrast, the demand\nfor insurance will be lower when wealth is higher and when insurance is more expensive relative to its\nactuarially fair value.\n3\nWhile the Lewis framework is useful for considering which factors may influence demand from a purely\ninsurance perspective, other considerations may also be important. For example, tax policy is likely to\ninfluence the demand for life insurance. First, in general, the proceeds from life insurance policies paid to\nthe beneficiaries upon the death of the insured are not taxed as income to the beneficiary and in certain\nsituations may not be subject to the estate tax either.3 Second, life insurance policies with a savings component,\nsometimes referred to as “cash value” insurance products, are not subject to capital gains taxes on any growth\nof the initial investment. This feature is similar to that of certain retirement and educational savings plans\nsuch as Roth IRAs and 529 college savings plans.\nIn addition to tax considerations, households may be motivated by a desire to leave bequests to future generations.\nBernheim (1991) analyzes the demand for life insurance in the context of ascertaining the degree to which\nhousehold savings are driven by a bequest or purely precautionary (or insurance) motive. His idea is that\nSocial Security endows households with an annuity and that households who wish to transfer that annuity\nto their children will purchase life insurance, which can be thought of as selling an annuity. He estimates\nlife insurance demand as a function of Social Security benefits, lifetime resources (the actuarial value of\nprivate pension and Social Security benefits plus accumulated net lifetime earnings), the presence of children,\nwidowed or widower status, marital status, and age. He finds that the propensity to hold life insurance and\nthe amount of life insurance held are positively related to Social Security benefits, lifetime resources, and\nthe presence of children. They are negatively related to age and widowed or widower status. His estimates\nare based on an analysis of the 1975 wave of Longitudinal Retirement History Survey respondents who were\n64 to 69 years old.\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nConsistent with the theoretical literature that emphasizes the role of life insurance in protecting survivors\nwhen a primary breadwinner dies, Liebenberg, Carson, and Dumm (2012) identify a significant positive\nrelationship between important life events, such as marriage or the birth of a child, and the demand for life\ninsurance. Their study also finds support for the “emergency fund” hypothesis, where households that are hit\nby an unemployment shock are more inclined than others to use cash value life insurance to smooth shocks\nby surrendering cash value life insurance policies to provide extra income during the period of unemployment.\nChen, Wong, and Lee (2001) study changes in the demand for life insurance from 1949 to 1996 in the United\nStates. They note that the decrease in the purchase of life insurance is especially prominent among house-\nholds whose members belong to more recent birth cohorts. Their analysis attributes the decline in life insurance\nownership over this period to two main factors: a higher share of individuals living alone without dependents\nand trends toward getting married later in life, which often delays the decision to have children.\nBrown and Goolsbee (2002) document a drop in the price of term life insurance in the late 1990s, coinciding\nwith the introduction of internet sites that allowed for easy comparison of insurance costs. This development\nis likely to have reduced search costs for shopping for term life policies. In contrast, the prices of insurance\nproducts, such as whole life, not covered by the comparison sites (due to higher product heterogeneity)\nwere not affected.\nMulholland, Finke, and Huston (2016) study the role of demographic and tax code changes that occurred\nfrom 1992 through 2010 in the decline in ownership of cash value life insurance. They found some evidence\nin line with the hypothesis that there was less demand for cash value life insurance in the wake of the 1998\nintroduction of saving vehicles, like the Roth IRA, with tax advantages similar to those of life insurance,\nallowing investments to grow in value tax free, for example. They were unable to find evidence that changes\nin estate taxation levels have influenced life insurance demand, however. This may be due to a lack of\npower in their test, given the small number of households for whom changes in the estate tax are consequential.\nOur data\nWe use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to analyze trends in life insurance ownership.\n4 The SCF is administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System every three years and\nprovides comprehensive financial and demographic data for U.S. households. We analyze the earliest and\nlatest waves of the SCF with consistent questions and methodologies, 1989 and 2013, and restrict our attention\nto households whose heads are between the ages of 18 and 75.4 Following the literature that emphasizes the\nimportance of household characteristics in the decision to purchase life insurance, we study life insurance\nownership at the level of the household.\nThere are two technical factors that are important to address in using the SCF data: weighting and imputation.\nEach SCF data set contains weights that indicate the number of households in the population that are represented\nby each household in the sample. We apply these weights to the data, which corrects for the over-sampling\nof wealthy households and makes the analysis representative of U.S. households. In addition, the SCF uses\na multiple imputation process to estimate a value for questions that the respondent did not answer. This\nprocess creates five observations or “implicates” for each survey respondent. For our analysis, we select\none of the five implicates at random.\nThe SCF asks respondents if they own any life insurance and specifically whether they own “term” insur-\nance or “cash value” insurance.5 Term life insurance pays out if the policyholder dies during the term of\nthe policy, the specified period that the policy is in force. Once the term is over, there is no payout should\nthe policyholder die. In purchasing a term policy, a household has to decide how long they want coverage\nfor (the term) and how much coverage they want (the payout in the event of a death during the term).

These features can make\ncash value policies an attractive tax shelter, particularly for wealthier households.\nUnderstanding the decline in life insurance ownership\nLife insurance ownership has declined in every SCF survey year since 1989. These trends are summarized\nin figure 1 and table 2. Overall life insurance ownership fell by 16.5 percentage points from 1989 to 2013,\ngoing from 76.7 percent to 60.2 percent, a 21.5 percent decline. These trends are apparent for both term and\ncash value policies. From 1989 to 2013, the ownership of term life policies fell by 7.9 percentage points,\n5\ngoing from 58.1 percent to 50.2 percent, a decline of 13.5 percent. Cash value life insurance ownership\ndropped by 18.7 percentage points, going from 37.4 percent to 18.7 percent, a decline of nearly 50 percent,\nover the same period. The trends observed in the SCF are consistent with those from industry data sources\n(Retzloff, 2010).\nSo how has life insurance ownership changed across socioeconomic and demographic groups? As we see\nin table 3,6 Hispanic households have the lowest rates of life insurance ownership in both 1989 and 2013,\nwith just 28.4 percent having term and 6.4 percent having cash value insurance in 2013. African American\nhouseholds have somewhat lower rates of life insurance ownership than whites, but the differences in\nownership rates across these two groups are relatively small. For example, in 2013, 54 percent of white\nhouseholds owned a term policy, compared with 49 percent of African American households. The gap for\ncash value insurance is even smaller, with a white ownership rate of 21 percent and an African American\nownership rate of 19 percent. These relatively small gaps are notable because for other common financial\nproducts, African American ownership rates are well below those of whites. For example, 40 percent of\nAfrican American households have a savings or checking account compared with 55 percent of white households,\nand just 3 percent of African American households own stock compared with 17 percent of white households\n(figures from the 2013 SCF).7 When we examine life insurance ownership rates by income and education,\nwe see substantial differences in ownership between the lowest groups and the highest groups. Among\nhouseholds in the bottom income quintile in 2013, 19 percent have a term life policy and 9 percent have a\ncash value policy. The comparable figures for the highest income quintile are 76 percent and 26 percent.\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nTABLE 2\nTrends in life insurance ownership: Overall trends\n1989 2013 Change from 1989 to 2013\n(% change) (level change)\nLife insurance ownership through time (%)\nAny life insurance 76.7 60.2 –21.5 –16.5\nTerm life insurance 58.1 50.2 –13.5 –7.9\nCash value life insurance 37.4 18.7 –49.9 –18.7\nValue of life insurance policies through time\nFace value, term life insurance $155,996 $353,288 126.5 $197,292\n($295,301) ($1,409,545)\nFace value, cash value life insurance $157,902 $225,894 43.1 $67,992\n($356,907) ($1,279,715)\nValue of cash value policy $20,290 $35,896 76.9 $15,606\n($89,452) ($217,287)\nMean value relative to annual income\nFace value of term/income 2.05 3.28 60.0 1.23\n(4.03) (5.67)\nFace value of cash value/income 2.07 2.43 17.3 0.36\n(5.03) (10.71)\nCash value of cash value/income 0.24 0.36 52.4 0.12\n(0.55) (1.07)\nNotes: Table reports sample means, growth rates of means, and changes in means.

In percentage\nterms, the declines have generally been largest among the lower-education and lower-income households\nfor term life products and among the higher-education and lower-income households for cash value\nproducts. As a result, the gaps in ownership between high-education and low-education or high-income and\nlow-income households have tended to widen for term life between 1989 and 2013 and shrink for cash value\nlife insurance over the same period. For example, from 1989 to 2013, ownership of term life policies declined\nby 42 percent among households in the bottom quintile of the income distribution, going from 32.5 percent\nto 18.8 percent. Among households in the highest income quintile, ownership of term life policies declined\nby just 0.3 percentage points, from 76 percent to 75.7 percent.

These calculations suggest households with\nlife insurance in 2013 had greater coverage than households in 1989. For term life, the average number of\nyears of income represented by the face value rose from 2.1 in 1989 to 3.3 in 2013. For cash value policies,\nthere was an increase from 2.1 years in 1989 to 2.4 years in 2013. In addition, the average accumulated\nsavings component of a cash value policy rose from 0.24 years in 1989 to 0.36 years in 2013. So while\nfewer households owned life insurance in 2013 than in 1989, those that did had higher levels of coverage\nin 2013 than in 1989.\nCharacterizing the demand for life insurance\nWe characterize the factors associated with life insurance ownership at a point in time using a simple linear\nregression framework. The dependent and explanatory variables in the analysis are motivated by the literature\nand summarized in equation 1. We use a linear probability model to estimate the probability that a house-\nhold owns life insurance. We examine three binary outcome variables: owning any life insurance, owning\nterm life insurance, and owning cash value life insurance. We consider the two types of policies separately for\nseveral reasons, including differing trends in ownership, differences in price trajectories highlighted in Brown\nand Goolsbee (2002), and the likely differences in the motivations associated with purchasing insurance\nthat provides protection only versus one that bundles that protection with a tax-protected investment vehicle.\nSpecifically, we estimate the following equation:\n2) Y =α +β x +ε .\ni,j,t t i,j i,t i,j,t\nThe variable Y is equal to one if household i owns life insurance of type j in year t and is zero otherwise.\ni,j,t\nWe estimate this equation for two cross sections of data corresponding to t = 1989 and 2013. The explanatory\nvariables included in the vector x are largely the same as those used in Mulholland, Finke, and Huston\ni,t\n(2016) to investigate the decrease in ownership of cash value life insurance. These include: sex, race (we\nuse the SCF categories: white, black, Hispanic, and other), age, age-squared, educational attainment\n(categories include less than a high school diploma, some college, and college degree or higher), income\n9 quintiles, net worth quintiles, an indicator for high net worth (net worth that is greater than or equal to ten\ntimes income), an indicator for whether the individual has mortgage, credit card, or other debt (which include\nloans against pensions, loans against life insurance, margin loans, and miscellaneous loans), an indicator\nfor the presence of children, an indicator for whether the respondent is married, and an indicator for home-\nownership. These variables are summarized in table 4.\nAs highlighted in Lewis (1989), life insurance may be purchased as a means to protect dependents from\nthe financial repercussions of the death of the primary earner. For this reason, households with a sole earner\nor with children might be more likely to purchase life insurance. For households with little wealth, income is\nexpected to play an important role in determining the demand for life insurance since it is likely to be correlated\nwith the amount of household expenses that may remain after the death of the primary earner. A similar\nrelationship may hold between the propensity to own life insurance and wealth. However, at higher levels\nof wealth, household demand for life insurance may decrease as these households may have sufficient\nresources to self-insure against the possible loss of future income due to the death of a policyholder, as is\nimplied by equation 1.\nEducation and financial literacy may help households understand the costs and benefits of life insurance\npolicies, possibly making more-educated and financially literate households more likely to own a policy.\nIn addition, the educational attainment of parents may be an indicator of the expected educational expenses\nof children. This suggests that more-educated parents may have a higher demand for life insurance so that\nthey ensure that the costs of educating children will be covered, even in the event that one of the parents\ndies prematurely.\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nTABLE 4\nSummary statistics\n1989 mean 1989 median 2013 mean 2013 median\nAge (years) 45.19 42 47.78 48\n(15.12) (14.58)\nMarried (%) 59.82 59.12\nHave children (%) 50.65 45.79\nNumber of children 1.00 1 0.88 0\n(1.22) (1.17)\nMale (%) 73.72 73.57\nBlack/African American (%) 13.05 15.21\nHispanic/Latino (%) 8.14 11.26\nOther race (%) 4.80 5.02\nYears of education 12.70 12 13.65 14\n(3.11) (2.65)\nHigh school diploma (%) 31.44 28.92\nSome college (%) 21.19 24.86\nCollege degree + (%) 24.43 35.16\nHomeowner (%) 63.58 63.59\nRenter or other (%) 36.42 36.40\nHave mortgage, credit, or other debt (%) 60.99 63.07\nHave IRA account (%) 26.23 28.30\nIncome (2013 $) 76,293 49,024 90,700 49,712\n(311,672) (387,916)\nNet worth (2013 $) 330,680 84,142 524,279 70,200\n10 (1,747,816) (3,611,244)\nNet worth ≥ 10x income (%) 9.12 9.93\nNotes: Means; standard errors in parentheses.

We focus our discussion on the ownership of\nterm and cash value life insurance, specifically on the results shown in columns 3 through 6. Consistent\nwith the theoretical work on the demand for life insurance discussed earlier, we find that married households\nare more likely to have term life insurance as are households with more education and income (although\nthe specific patterns vary somewhat between 1989 and 2013). In addition, we find that households with a\nnet worth that is at least ten times their income are less likely to own term life insurance. This is consistent\nwith equation 1 and the literature that argues that very wealthy households may have lower demand for\ninsurance because they can self-insure by using their accumulated wealth to cushion the financial impact\nof a negative shock.

no significant\nimpact on the likelihood of owning term life insurance. Perhaps the presence of children is not important\nonce all of the other variables are controlled for. Older households are more likely to own term life insurance,\nalthough the effect of age diminishes as household heads age. The peak effect of age on term life insurance\nownership is about 47 years of age, near the age at which the earnings of an average worker reach their peak\nas well (Guvenen et al., 2016), consistent with the literature that argues that the demand for life insurance\nincreases with earnings. The regression patterns echo the stark differences in term life insurance ownership\nacross racial groups and suggest that the patterns that we described earlier persist even when other characteristics\nare controlled for and that differences in insurance ownership are not due simply to differences in observables\nacross racial groups. Black households are between 8 and 13 percentage points more likely to own term\nlife insurance than otherwise similar white households. In contrast, Hispanic households are between 10 and\n14 percentage points less likely to own term life insurance than otherwise similar white households.\nWhile the general relationships between the independent variables and the likelihood of owning a term life\npolicy are similar in 1989 and 2013, there are a few differences in the estimates that are worth highlighting.\nFor example, in 1989 households whose heads’ highest educational attainment is a high school diploma\nare significantly more likely to own term life policies than those who did not complete high school. In 2013,\nthere is no significant difference in ownership between those whose highest level of education is a high school\ndiploma and those who have not completed high school. In addition, term life ownership appears to be\nmore sensitive to net worth and income in 2013 than in 1989. The coefficients on the net worth quintiles\nare more likely to be significant in the 2013 estimates. Finally, taken together, the dependent variables\nexplain more of the variation in ownership of term life policies in 2013, where the adjusted R-squared is\n21.1 percent versus 14.4 percent for the 1989 regression.\nNext, we discuss the estimates of the likelihood of owning cash value life insurance in 1989 and 2013. The\nliterature on life insurance ownership speaks less directly to the motivations for owning cash value life\ninsurance, which is both an investment vehicle and a tool for insuring against the financial consequences of\ndeath. In contrast to the pattern observed for term life insurance, the explanatory power of the estimates of\ncash value life insurance ownership is higher in 1989 than in 2013, with an adjusted R-squared of 17.4 percent\n13 in 1989 and 7.9 percent in 2013. While the sex of the household head had no significant impact on term\nlife insurance ownership, it is significantly correlated with cash value life insurance ownership. In 1989,\nmale-headed households were 8 percentage points more likely to own cash value life insurance policies\nthan female-headed households. In 2013, we see the opposite, with male-headed households being 3 percentage\npoints less likely to own cash value life insurance. As is the case with term life, black households are more\nlikely to own cash value life insurance and Hispanic households are less likely to own it than otherwise\nsimilar white households. The relationship between cash value life insurance ownership and age differs\nfrom that of term life. Focusing on the 2013 estimates in which the coefficients on age and age-squared\nare significant, we see that the likelihood of owning cash value life insurance is a decreasing function of\nage until about age 35, but it increases thereafter. Education does not play a significant role in determining\nthe ownership of a cash value policy in 1989. However, in 2013 it does, and households whose highest\neducational attainment is a high school diploma or more are 4–6 percentage points more likely to own a\ncash value policy than their counterparts who did not complete high school. Relative to the patterns for term\nlife, income plays little role in determining who owns cash value policies, but wealth is strongly correlated\nwith having a cash value policy and wealthier households are more likely to have such a policy, as are\nhouseholds with an IRA or a Keogh account and households who have debts. In contrast to term life,\nhouseholds whose net worth is ten or more times their income are not significantly more likely to have a\ncash value policy. This finding is consistent with the view that it is possible to use accumulated wealth as\na substitute for a term life policy but not for the investment component of a cash value policy.\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nOaxaca–Blinder decomposition\nTo study how much of the change in life insurance ownership between 1989 and 2013 can be explained by\nthe data, we employ a Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition (see Oaxaca, 1973; and Blinder, 1973). After taking\nexpectations, the difference between estimates of equation 1 for 2013 and 1989 can be rearranged to attribute\nthe change in life insurance ownership between 1989 and 2013 to two main factors: differences in the\ncharacteristics of the population and differences in the coefficients, or differences in the relationship between\nthese characteristics and the outcomes. For example, one component of the total change in life insurance\nownership might be changes in the share of household heads who have completed high school between 1989\nand 2013. Another source of change could be changes in how likely high school graduates are to own life\ninsurance in 1989 versus 2013. The first case is an example of a difference that can be attributed to changes\nin the characteristics of the population between 1989 and 2013: changes in the share of households in various\ncategories—sex, race, age, education, income, net worth, debt, having children, and homeownership status.\nThe second example is a change in life insurance ownership that can be attributed to a change in the estimated\ncoefficients for a given characteristic, or in other words, a change in the prevalence of life insurance owner-\nship within a group that shares a characteristic. The following equation illustrates the linear decomposition:\nY −Y =β(cid:31)(x −x )+ ( β(cid:31) −β(cid:31)) x + ( β(cid:31) −β(cid:31))(x −x )..\n13 89 89 13 89 13 89 89 13 89 13 89\nThe first term, β(x −x ), denotes differences attributable to changes in the characteristics of the population\n89 13 89\n(the x values). The second term,\n( β −β)\nx , measures differences due to changes in the relationship\n13 89 89\nbetween characteristics and the likelihood of owning life insurance (the β values or coefficients). Finally,\nthe third term, ( β −β)(x −x ), is an interaction term that accounts for the fact that both the explanatory\n13 89 13 89\nvariables and coefficients are changing over the period.9\nFigure 5 shows how changes in the demographic and financial characteristics of the population between\n1989 and 2013 and changes in the estimated coefficients impact predicted rates of life insurance ownership.\n14 The height of the first bar in each group shows the percentage of households who owned life insurance in\n1989 and the last bar displays the analogous information for 2013. The height of the second bar corresponds\nto the share of households that would be predicted to own life insurance if they had 2013 characteristics\nand the estimated coefficients from 1989. The third bar uses coefficients from 2013 and characteristics from\n1989. Comparing the first two bars in each group, it is evident that we would predict a slight increase in\ninsurance ownership between 1989 and 2013, taking into account only the changes in the characteristics of\nthe population and holding the estimated coefficients fixed at their 1989 values. Using the 1989 coefficients,\nthe predicted share of the population that would own life insurance would rise from 76.7 percent in 1989\nto 78.4 percent in 2013. Figure 5 shows similar patterns when considering term and cash value life insurance\nseparately. In other words, looking just at the characteristics of the population in 2013 relative to 1989, we\nwould have expected life insurance ownership to rise.10\nOf course, this is not what happened. Instead of a slight increase in life insurance ownership, we observe\na significant decline. According to our estimates, much of the explanation for this drop is due to changes\nin the estimated coefficients—or the likelihood that a household with a given characteristic purchases life\ninsurance. This can be seen by comparing the second bar in figure 5 with the fourth bar. The height of the\nsecond bar corresponds to the share of 2013 households that would have been predicted to buy life insurance\nif they behaved like 1989 households. The fourth bar shows the share of 2013 households that actually bought\nlife insurance. The difference in predicted ownership is stark. With 1989 behavior, 78.4 percent of 2013\nhouseholds would have been predicted to own life insurance; instead the actual prevalence of life insurance\nownership among these households is 60.2 percent. We see similar patterns for term and cash value insurance:\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nFIGURE 5\nActual and predicted life insurance ownership\npercent\n90.0\n80.0 78.4%\n76.7%\n70.0\n60.2% 60.6%\n60.0 58.7% 58.4%\n49.3% 50.2%\n50.0\n40.0 37.4% 38.0%\n30.0\n20.0 17.5% 18.7%\n10.0\n0.0\nLife insurance Term insurance Cash value insurance\n1989 ownership βˆ x βˆ x 2013 ownership\n89 13 13 89\nNotes: All observations have been weighted to reflect the U.S. population and all dollar values have been adjusted to 2013\ndollars.

The share of the changes in any life insurance ownership\nand term life insurance ownership that can be explained by changing demographic and financial characteristics\nand the interaction term is negative, implying that changes in the coefficients must account for more than\n100 percent of the change in predicted ownership. The share of the changes in cash value life insurance that\ncan be explained by changes in demographic and financial characteristics, similar to both overall life and term life\ninsurance ownership, is negative. The share of the change in cash value life insurance explained by the inter-\naction term is positive, but near zero. In sum, the decline in life insurance ownership is overwhelmingly driven\nby changes in the likelihood that an individual with a particular characteristic purchases life insurance.\nThe results of this exercise are somewhat unsatisfying, in that they tell us that life insurance has gone down be-\ncause behavior has changed for many households, but they do not tell us much about why that behavior may\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nFIGURE 6 FIGURE 7\nPercent of outcome gap explained by Individuals with internet access at home\ncoefficients, characteristics,\npercentage of inviduals with internet\nand interactions\n100\n90\npercent\n140 80\n126.8%\n120 110.3% 70\n103.2%\n100 60\n80 50\n60 40\n40 30\n20 20\n2.7%\n0 10\n–0.6%\n–20 –9.7% –11.0% –6.4% 0\n–15.9%\n–40 ’97 2001 ’03 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’12\nLife insurance Term insurance Cash value\ninsurance Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population\nSurvey, Computer and Internet Use Tables, available online,\n% Explained by coefficients\nhttps://www.census.gov/topics/population/computer-internet/\n% Explained by characteristics data/tables.ALL.html.\n% Explained by interactions\nhave changed.

Recall that the share of the variation in\nSystem, Survey of Consumer Finances.\nownership (the adjusted R-squared) that is explained\nby the regressions varies from 27.6 percent for owning\n16 any life insurance in 1989 to 7.9 percent for owning cash value life insurance in 2013. While these are\nrespectable figures from a statistical perspective, they suggest that much of the story remains to be told.\nThe Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition provides some direction in where we should look for the rest of the\nstory. The fact that the coefficients drive most of the decline in ownership means that we should be looking\nfor trends that might influence the behavior of many households, rather than particular subsets of house-\nholds. Relevant factors might include trends in the cost of life insurance, how easy it is to purchase, and\nthe availability and cost of substitutes for life insurance (especially relevant for cash value insurance). For\nexample, between 1989 and 2013 internet usage increased dramatically (see figure 7). This would tend to\nmake it easier for households to shop and compare the cost of life insurance from various sources. Brown\nand Goolsbee (2002) argue that this brought down the cost of term life insurance. Over the same period, the\navailability and cost of substitutes for the investment component of cash value life insurance, in particular,\nmay have changed. Figure 8 shows a significant decrease in mutual fund fees over this period. In addition,\nMulholland, Finke, and Huston (2016) provide evidence that changes in the tax code that created competition\nfor the tax-protected investment features of cash value life insurance may have played a role in the declining\ndemand for this insurance product.\nAdditional factors that might be important include changes in life expectancy and the extent to which government\nprograms provide insurance against the death of a primary wage earner. Trends in life expectancy are shown\nin figure 9. The large increase in life expectancy between 1989 and 2013 is likely to play a prominent role\nin explaining the decline in life insurance ownership over this period.

Recent trends in\ninterest rates may also have dampened the demand for cash value life insurance, in particular. The ability\nto shield investment return from taxes through a cash value life insurance policy is more valuable when\nnominal returns are higher. When interest rates are low, investment returns, and hence the taxes that might\nbe due on those returns, are lower as well. As a result, the ability to invest through a tax-protected vehicle,\nsuch as cash value life insurance, is less valuable in a low interest rate environment.\n17\nConclusion\nThis article examines trends in life insurance ownership across time and among different types of house-\nholds. We document substantial differences in the propensity to own life insurance among households with\ndifferent demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. One fact that stands out is the high life insurance\nownership rates of African American households, especially relative to low ownership of other financial\nassets among these households.\nWe also investigate the substantial decline in life insurance ownership from 1989 to 2013 and find that house-\nholds with characteristics that would have made them likely owners of life insurance in 1989 were much\nless likely to purchase life insurance in 2013. The propensity to purchase life insurance has fallen dramat-\nically across a wide swath of the population since 1989. An interesting pattern emerges when we compare\nchanges in term life insurance ownership and cash value life insurance ownership for high- and low-income\nhouseholds. There has been a substantial drop in term life ownership for low-income households, but only\na small decrease in term life ownership for high-income households. We see the opposite pattern for changes\nin cash value life insurance ownership; it has dropped the least for low-income households and dropped\nthe most for high-income households. That being said, the decline in life insurance ownership is broad-based—\nshowing up across race, education, and income subgroups. This implies that the explanation for the decline\nin life insurance lies in factors that influence many households rather than just a few. We highlight a few\nof these trends: changes in life expectancy and changes in factors such as the tax code, internet usage, and\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\nmutual fund fees that are likely to influence the price of life insurance as well as the availability of substitutes\nfor the investment component of cash value life insurance. Interesting questions for future research include\nwhy life insurance ownership rates for African American households are so high relative to their ownership\nof other financial assets and how increases in mortality rates for certain demographic groups documented\nin Case and Deaton (2017) influence the demand for life insurance.\nNOTES\n1When l = 1, the insurance is actuarially fair, meaning that the present value of the cost of the insurance is\nequal to the present value of the expected payments under the insurance contract. Insurance is typically sold\nwith a markup, meaning that l is greater than 1 and costs exceed expected payments.\n2Note that when the price of insurance is actuarially fair (l = 1), the term in square brackets equals one\nand the risk aversion of the dependents plays no role. This is due to the fact that if the price of insurance is\nactuarially fair, then it is optimal to fully insure, meaning that consumption will be the same in all possible\nstates of the world, eliminating risk.\n3This website, http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/transferlifeinsurance.asp, provides a description\nof the tax treatment of life insurance death benefits.\n4The SCF is conducted every three years. As of the time of our writing, June 2017, the 2013 SCF is the\nmost recent year for which survey data is available.\n5There may be important distinctions in the reasons for purchasing life insurance that is meant to cover\nend-of-life expenses versus policies that are intended to replace the income of the deceased. Insurers tend\nto refer to these low-dollar amount face value policies as burial, funeral, or final expense insurance. These\npolicies are offered in both term and cash value varieties. We have repeated all of the analysis in the article\nwith a definition of life insurance ownership that requires the face value of the policy to be greater than the 10th\npercentile of the face values we observe for each product and each year. This cutoff is $7,256 for term life\nin 1989, $10,000 in 2013, $7,256 for cash value life insurance in 1989, and $7,000 in 2013. This analysis\nyields results that are largely the same as what we present here. As a result, we use a definition of life insurance\n18\nownership that is equal to one even for policies with a small face value.\n6We use the demographic characteristics of the head of the household to divide households into groups.\n7In fact, our regression estimates in table 5 show that once we control for education, income, wealth, and\nother characteristics, African Americans are more likely to own life insurance than whites. This may be\nrelated to the important role of African American-owned life insurance firms from the early 1920s through\nthe 1960s (Heen, 2009; and Chapin, 2012). Another possible explanation is that higher mortality rates for\nAfrican Americans make it optimal for more African Americans than whites to choose to own life insurance.\nHowever, there is evidence that African Americans, on average, expect to live six years longer than their\nactuarial life expectancy while whites’ subjective and actuarial life expectancies are much closer (Mirowsky,\n1999). We have replicated similar findings using data from the SCF. Studying the reasons for high rates of\nlife insurance ownership among African Americans is an important topic for future research.\n8All dollar figures are reported in real 2013 dollars.\n9We assess the degree to which changes in explanatory variables could account for changes in life insurance\nownership if all demographic groups still purchased life insurance at the rate which they did in 1989. One\ncould also consider a similar exercise using the 2013 demographic group life insurance purchasing rates.\nEconomic Perspectives 8 / 2017 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n\n10Note that we come to the same conclusion when we compare the last two bars, which hold the estimated\ncoefficients fixed at their 2013 values. Using 2013 coefficients, we would have expected life insurance\nownership to rise from 58.7 percent in 1989 to 60.2 percent in 2013 based on changes in characteristics\nof the population.\n11It is important to note that this is a decomposition of the variation that is explained by the regression model.\nFor example, the R-squared terms in columns 1 and 2 of table 5 indicate that roughly one-quarter of the\nvariation in the data is explained by the regression model.\nREFERENCES\nBernheim, B.

We do this in two steps. First,\nin table 4, we show the average benefit\nreceived from the different programs\nby demographic group. These are aver-\nage monthly benefit amounts among\nall households in the group. In the final\ncolumn of table 4, we sum cash transfer\nincome across all the different programs.\nThe elderly receive the largest transfers\non average per month ($1,420), followed\nby the disabled ($1,059) and veterans\n($999). Second, in table 5 (p. 124), we\ntabulate the percentage of total house-\nhold income that is received from the\ndifferent transfer programs. In this\ncase, household income is defined as\nthe sum of cash transfers, the value of\nFood Stamp Program (Supplemental\nNutrition Assistance Program) benefits,\nand other income. While the average\nU.S. household receives 11 percent of\nits income from transfer programs\n(table 5, final row), some groups of households receive (on average) nearly\nhalf of their income from these pro-\ngrams. In both tables 4 and 5, we are\nnot imputing values to in-kind assis-\ntance, such as Medicare and housing\nassistance, so these numbers under-\nestimate true total transfer benefits.\nWe have looked at program partici-\npation, benefit levels, and income ratios.\nBy examining transfer programs and\ntheir participants in this way, we find\nthat there are certain demographic groups\nthat are particularly dependent on trans-\nfer income. We choose to further inves-\ntigate those groups whose average\nhousehold (based on the data in table 3)\nreceives benefits from two or more\ntransfer programs (namely, those with\nless than a high school diploma, the el-\nderly, the disabled, single mothers, and\nthe poor) and also those groups whose\nratio of average monthly transfer in-\ncome to average total monthly income\n(based on the data in table 5) exceeds\n25 percent (namely, those with less\nthan a high school diploma, the elderly,\nthe disabled, and the poor).

In particular, total expenditures are\nhigher for those with a high school diploma than\nthose without one, for the nonelderly than the\nelderly, for the nondisabled than the disabled, for\nnon-single-mothers than single mothers, and for\nthe nonpoor than the poor. In short, individuals in\nour groups of interest spend less on average than\nindividuals in the remainder of the population.\nWe measure the inflation of a group as the\nweighted average of the price changes of the items\npurchased by households in that group, with the\nweights depending on the market basket of the group\nin question. For example, because the elderly spend\nmore on health care than the nonelderly, the price\nchanges in health items get a larger weight in the\ncalculation of the inflation of the elderly than the\nnonelderly. Given the differences in consumption\npatterns shown in table 6, panel A (p. 125), we would\nexpect to find differences in inflation experiences if\nprice changes across categories differ dramatically.\nFor example, in a period of rapidly increasing oil\nprices, we would expect that the inflation experi-\nenced by households that commute less, such as\nthe elderly and the disabled, would be lower than\nthat experienced by commuting households, all\nelse being equal.\nBefore calculating inflation experiences of dif-\nferent groups, we would like to develop some intu-\nition for the results by displaying price changes of\ngoods in different categories. In table 7, panels A\nand B, we show how prices have changed in the\nbroad expenditure categories displayed in table 6,\npanels A and B. We show price changes for six dif-\nferent periods: 1980–2010, 1980–90, 1990–2000,\n2000–10, 1980–2008, and 2008–10. As noted in the\nintroduction and summary, we divide the period\n1980–2010 into 1980–2008 and 2008–10 because\nof the unusual patterns of price changes and COLAs\nduring the recent recession and subsequent recovery.\nAll price changes are based on August-to-August\ninflation rates. Panel A of table 7 shows the total\nprice change over the periods, while panel B shows\naverage annual rates during the periods. For example,\nthe 249 percent for food inflation over the period\n1980–2010 in panel A of table 7 means that nominal\nfood prices in August 2010 were 249 percent of their August 1980 level. In addition, the average annual\nrate of food inflation over the period 1980–2010\nwas 3 percent, as shown in panel B of table 7.\nWe see in both panels of table 7 that inflation\nrates have differed across the expenditure categories.\nFor some categories, in particular health, education,\nand tobacco, price growth has been above the total\n\nprice growth (as shown in the final column) during all Over the 1980–2010 period, the highest levels of\nthree decades of the 1980–2010 period.

We focus on\nfour programs—Social Security, SSI, TANF,\nand SNAP.\nSocial Security and SSI\nWe begin by looking at the Social\nSecurity and SSI COLA and the inflation\nexperiences of the elderly and the disabled.\nSocial Security and SSI benefits (for both\nthe elderly and the disabled) have been in-\ndexed to the (seasonally unadjusted) CPI-W\nsince 1975. Benefits for the Civil Service\nRetirement System, military retirement, and\nveterans service-connected compensation are all indexed in the same way.\nIn table 9, panel A, we show the increase\nin the CPI-W in the first column of data.

In the next two\ncolumns, the numbers displayed for the various\nperiods are the same as those measuring the\ninflation faced by the elderly and the disabled\nwith annual weights and fixed weights in\ntable 8, panels A and B, respectively.\nFrom table 9, panel A, we see that for\nboth annual-weighted and fixed-weighted in-\nflation measures, the inflation experienced by\nthe elderly has been almost always higher than the CPI-W, both over the entire period\nand for each of the three decades covered by\nthe data. Over the entire 30-year period, based\non annual weights, elderly inflation has been\n14 percentage points above the CPI-W.

The main influence on their settlement\npattern is socioeconomic status.

Groups with limited financial\nmeans (Hmong,Bangladeshi, and Pakistani) have a very\ndifferent pattern. Because of their smaller numbers, limited\nfinancial means,and the housing market of southeastern\nMichigan, these groups primarily settle in older suburbs like\nHamtramck and Warrenor central cities like Detroit and\nPontiac. Group size influences the settlement patterns of\nMiddle Eastern immigrants as well. The largest groups\nimmigrating to southeast Michigan include persons from\nIraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

    "text": "THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ESSAYS ON ISSUES\nOF CHICAGO 2018 NUMBER 396\nhttps://doi.org/10.21033/cfl-2018-396\nChicago Fed Letter\nUnderstanding the demand for currency at home and abroad\nby Thomas Haasl, research assistant, Anna Paulson, senior vice president, associate director of research, and director of\nfinancial markets, and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, senior economist and research advisor\nCurrency is traditionally the largest liability of a central bank and today accounts for 36%\nof the Federal Reserve’s liabilities, or $1.59 trillion.1 The Fed supplies currency to meet\ndemand, so changes in the demand for currency will be an important determinant of how\nthe Fed’s balance sheet evolves in the future. In this Chicago Fed Letter, we examine\ncurrency demand around the world and over time to learn about the range of possibilities\nfor how U.S. currency demand might change. We then project currency demand over the\nnext decade in several illustrative scenarios.\nAn international perspective\nFigure 1 shows the ratio of currency to gross domestic product (GDP) over time for seven countries\n(Canada, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and the\neurozone. The relationship between currency demand and the size of an economy is not entirely\nclear-cut. We might expect currency use to\n1. Banknotes in circulation\nrise with GDP, because a larger economy\nwill have more transactions and thus more\npercent of nominal GDP\nneed for currency. But in fact, the ratio varies\n20\nboth between countries and over time for\n18\na given country. These variations help\n16\n14 reveal some of the main determinants of\n12 currency demand.\n10\n8 One important factor affecting currency\n6 demand is the adoption of alternative\n4\ntechnologies for making payments. In\n2\nJapan, a largely cash-based economy where\n0\n1981 ’85 ’89 ’93 ’97 2001 ’05 ’09 ’13 ’17 the use of credit cards and other electronic\npayments is relatively uncommon, currency\nCanada UK Switzerland Eurozone\nJapan U.S. Sweden India demand now stands at nearly 19% of GDP—\nthe highest of any country for which the\nSourceS: Data from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bank of Canada, Bank for International Settlements collects\nStatistics Canada, Reserve Bank of India, India Central Statistics Office,\nEconomic and Social Research Institute, Sweden Central Bank, Swiss statistics.2 But in Sweden, demand for currency\nState Secretariat for Economic Affairs, and Bank of England were obtained has plummeted in recent years as electronic\nvia Haver Analytics. Additional sources include the Bank of Japan,\nEurostat, Swiss National Bank, UK Office for National Statistics, and payment technologies have replaced cash.\nthe European Central Bank.\nThe large differences across countries\n\nsuggest that the adoption of new payment technologies is likely to be at least as important as whether\nthe technology exists: People know how to use credit and debit cards around the world, but they\nhave been much more eager to switch to cards in some places than others. Increased use of by-now\ntraditional electronic payment tools, such as credit cards, has been sufficient to dramatically reduce\ncurrency demand in countries such as Sweden.3 If cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin were ever to\nbecome widely used, the demand for cash could fall further.\nAnother important determinant of currency demand is the extent to which a country’s currency is\nused abroad. The U.S. and Canada have relatively similar economies, yet currency is now 8% of GDP\nin the U.S. and only 4% of GDP in Canada. The gap has risen over the three decades shown in\nfigure 1, which some analysts argue is related to the increasing use of U.S. dollars in other countries.\nGovernment policies can also cause sharp changes in currency relative to GDP, as can be seen in\nthe case of India. India’s share of currency to GDP fell sharply after November 8, 2016, when the\ngovernment announced that existing 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would no longer be valid and that\nthe old notes needed to be exchanged for new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes.4 The eurozone provides\nanother example of the impact of policy changes—in this case, the introduction of an entirely\nnew currency. Euro coins and bills were first distributed in late 2001 and became legal tender on\nJanuary 1, 2002, replacing the separate currencies of the countries that make up the eurozone.\nBut the quantity of euro currency in circulation that first day was less than people ultimately\ndemanded; as more euros were printed and as the new currency gained public acceptance, the\namount in circulation grew.\nFinally, the trends in figure 1 provide suggestive evidence that interest rates may affect the demand\nfor currency. Currency does not earn interest, while funds held in bank accounts typically do. Thus,\nwhen interest rates are low, the opportunity cost of holding currency instead of putting money in\nthe bank is lower, and people may tend to hold more currency. Consistent with this idea, we see\n2. Fed funds rate and U.S. currency-to-GDP ratio\ncurrency/GDP ratio (percent)\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nfed funds rate (percent)\nActual data Smoothed data Actual data: December 2015 Actual data: December 2017\nNote: The sample period begins in the second quarter of 1982 and ends in the last quarter of 2017.\nSourceS: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis via Haver Analytics.\n\nin figure 1 that the ratio of currency to GDP has risen since the financial crisis in Switzerland, the\nU.S., Canada, and the UK as all of those countries’ central banks have set interest rates at their\neffective lower bounds. And currency use began rising sharply in the mid-1990s in Japan, when\nthat country’s interest rates fell to near zero.5\nLow rates, lots of cash\nFigure 2 examines the relationship between interest rates and currency use for the U.S. The figure\nplots quarterly data on the ratio of currency to GDP on the vertical axis against the target federal\nfunds rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on the horizontal axis. Each dot\nshows data from a different quarter, and the solid line smooths out the dots to show the average\nrelationship between interest rates and currency. The overall negative relationship is clear—a rise\nin the fed funds rate from 0% to 2% has been associated, on average, with a 1 percentage point\ndrop in the ratio of currency to GDP.\nHowever, changes in factors other than interest rates may also have contributed to the relationship\nshown in the figure. For example, interest rates have generally been falling over the period shown\nin the data, while foreign demand for U.S. currency appears to have risen during that period for\nreasons other than interest rates. Thus, some of the apparent association between low interest\nrates and high currency demand may not actually be a function of interest rates. For this reason,\nwe cannot be sure that future changes in interest rates would cause currency demand to change\nby exactly the amount suggested by the figure.\nIndeed, the FOMC’s most recent series of rate increases is an exception to the typical relationship.\nFrom December 2015 to December 2017, the FOMC raised its target for the fed funds rate by 1 percentage\npoint. Yet the figure shows that the ratio of currency to GDP rose by 0.4 percentage points over\nthat time, indicating that influences other than interest rates have significantly affected the demand\nfor currency.\nExporting dollars\nPeople in other countries, especially countries with unstable financial systems, often use U.S. financial\nassets as a safe haven. U.S. currency is a particularly attractive asset for people who want a stable\ncurrency for their day-to-day transactions, as well as people who are engaged in illicit activities\nand do not want to put their money in a place where it would be visible to authorities, such as a\nfinancial security or bank account. As a result, demand for U.S. currency overseas is substantial.\nMuch of this demand is for $100 bills, whose high value makes them more convenient for trans-\nporting large sums of cash.\nFigure 3 shows estimates of the fraction of all U.S. currency and of $100 bills held overseas from\nFederal Reserve Board economist Ruth Judson.6 Paper currency is not easily tracked once the\ncentral bank distributes it, so the amount of U.S. currency abroad must be estimated. Judson’s\nestimates assume that, in the absence of foreign demand, the relationship between currency use\nand GDP in the U.S. would be the same as in Canada. In other words, she assumes that the higher\nratio of currency to GDP in the U.S. is due to foreign demand. The estimates suggest that more\nthan 60% of all U.S. bills and nearly 80% of $100 bills are now overseas—up from 15% to 30%\naround 1980. In her research, Judson has found that economic and political instability contribute\nto this demand.7\nFuture scenarios\nThe factors we’ve assessed suggest that to estimate future U.S. currency demand, we need to consider\nat least four key variables: the size of the economy, the adoption of new payment technologies that\n\n3.

As of March 14, 2018,\nU.S. currency outstanding was $1.59 trillion. Figure 4 shows estimates for what currency outstanding\nmight be ten years from now, in 2028, under three scenarios that take these variables into account.\nIn scenario 1, our baseline or middle scenario, we assume that the use of payment technologies\ndoesn’t change and that demand for U.S. currency, both at home and abroad, is driven by changes\nin the U.S.’s nominal GDP and interest rates. The FOMC’s median projection in March 2018 was\nthat the federal funds rate target in the long run will be 2.9%, up from a range of 1.50% to 1.75%\ntoday.8 Figure 2 shows that such a rise in the fed funds rate has historically been associated with\nreducing the ratio of domestic currency to GDP by about 1.03 percentage points. That would reduce\nthe currency/GDP ratio to 6.92%, compared with 7.95% today. Combined with the 3.9% average\nannual growth rate of nominal GDP projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in June\nof last year,9 this implies U.S. currency demand of $2 trillion ten years from now. The rising interest\nrates in this scenario mean that total currency demand grows more slowly than GDP and is $298 billion\nlower than it would be if interest rates were to stay at their March 2018 levels. As a result, in this\nscenario currency demand is somewhat lower than staff projections from the Fed’s Board of Governors\nthat assume currency will grow proportionately to GDP.10\nBut other outcomes are possible. As figure 1 shows, the ratio of currency to U.S. GDP has grown\nsteadily over time. From the end of 2014 through the end of 2017, the ratio grew by an average of\n0.06 percentage points per quarter. This might seem like a small change each quarter, but if that\nrate of change were to continue for ten years, the ratio of currency to GDP would reach 10.2% a\ndecade from now. Combined with the CBO’s projection for GDP growth and assuming that interest\nrates do not rise, currency demand would then reach $2.95 trillion. This number forms scenario\n2, our high scenario for currency demand.\nIn scenario 3, our low scenario, we assume that interest rates normalize and that rapid adoption\nof new payment technologies both in the U.S. and abroad causes the ratio of total currency to\n\n4.

This leaves the ratio of currency to GDP\nat about 1.73%, and with the CBO’s path for GDP growth, total currency demand would be just\n$501 billion. In this scenario, just over $1 trillion in currency would actually be returned to the Fed.\nConclusion\nWhile our low and high scenarios are perhaps unlikely, they illustrate the wide range of possible\noutcomes for currency demand and, as a result, for the future size of the currency component of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet. Projecting the demand for U.S. currency is challenging and requires a\nnumber of assumptions. Currency demand depends on how quickly the economy grows, on interest\nrates, on the invention and adoption of new payments technologies, and on whether people in\nother countries continue to see U.S. dollar bills as a useful asset—all factors that are, to say the\nleast, uncertain.\n1 We thank Michael Locke for excellent research assistance.

Funds in the TGA are an asset to the federal government and a liability to the Fed, just\nlike funds in checking accounts are assets to the households or firms that use the accounts and\nliabilities to commercial banks.\nHow does the flow of funds into and out of the TGA impact the size and make-up of the Federal\nReserve’s liabilities? When the U.S. government makes a payment, funds are withdrawn from the\nTGA and sent to the bank accounts of individuals or businesses. These transfers increase the reserves\nof the commercial banks that hold the private accounts. Similarly, when the government receives\na payment, the source of the payment is an individual or business account at a commercial bank\nand, ultimately, the reserves of the commercial bank. Like balances in the TGA, commercial banks’\nreserves are Fed liabilities—they account for a large part of the electronic liabilities category in\nfigure 1. As a result, when the government uses its checking account, the size of the Fed’s liabilities\nremains the same, but the composition changes.\nThe behavior of the TGA has changed substantially in recent years. Before the financial crisis, the\nTreasury mainly used accounts at commercial banks, known as Treasury Tax and Loan Note (TT&L)\naccounts, to receive income and make payments. As shown in the annual data in panel A of figure 2,\nduring this period the TGA balance at the Fed was small, only around $5 billion. Keeping the\nTreasury’s money at commercial banks helped prevent large payments to or from the Treasury\nfrom causing large fluctuations in the supply of bank reserves, which was important for the stability\nof money market interest rates in an era when bank reserves themselves were small.\nBut with the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet during the financial crisis, it was no longer as\nimportant to prevent fluctuations in the now much larger supply of bank reserves. In addition,\nwhen the Fed began paying interest on reserves in October 2008, the formulas that determined\nthe interest rates on TT&L accounts meant that it was less expensive for the Treasury to keep its\nmoney in the TGA than to use TT&L accounts.2 The Treasury therefore shifted essentially all of\nits balances to the TGA, resulting in the first upward jump shown in panel A of figure 2, in 2008.\nIn 2015, the size of the TGA took a second jump upward when the Treasury decided to maintain\na substantial balance in the account at all times to ensure it could pay the government’s bills even\nif a disaster interrupted access to financial markets.3 The Treasury now aims to have enough cash\non hand to cover one week of payments, subject to a minimum of $150 billion at times of the year\nwhen one week’s payments are expected to be small.\n\n3. Federal Reserve notes and electronic liabilities\n$ billions\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n0\n1980 ’82 ’84 ’86 ’88 ’90 ’92 ’94 ’96 ’98 2000 ’02 ’04 ’06 ’08 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16\nFederal Reserve notes Electronic liabilities\nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System via Haver Analytics.\nThe expansion of the TGA has also made the account’s balance much more volatile, as illustrated\nby the weekly data in panel B of figure 2. The account now fluctuates between about $20 billion\nand nearly $450 billion. This volatility has two sources. First, the government’s income and outlays\nare naturally volatile, with large tax payments arriving in some weeks and large expenditures leaving\nthe account in other weeks. Second, as the figure shows, the Treasury occasionally reduces the\naccount balance below the $150 billion minimum that it ordinarily targets. These reductions\ngenerally occur when the Treasury approaches the debt ceiling—a limit set by Congress on the\namount of money the government can borrow. Similar to a household that wants to pay its bills\nwithout taking out a loan, the Treasury, when it faces a tight debt limit, must spend down its checking\naccount until Congress allows it to borrow more. These factors mean that if the Treasury maintains\nits current approach to cash management, the Federal Reserve’s liabilities to the Treasury in future\nyears will be both larger and more volatile than they were before the financial crisis.\nCurrency\nFigure 3 shows the annual history of Federal Reserve notes that make up the vast majority of paper\ncurrency in the United States.4 Currency is an asset to the households and firms that hold it, because\nthey can exchange their currency for valuable goods and services. But currency is a liability to the\ncentral bank that issues it—a promise to stand behind the currency’s value in the future.\nCurrency has traditionally been the Fed’s largest liability. The Federal Reserve Act, the law that\ncreated the Fed in 1913, sets out as one of its purposes “to furnish an elastic currency.” Policymakers\nhave interpreted this mandate as calling for the Fed to provide enough currency for the wheels of\ncommerce to turn smoothly. When the U.S. economy grows, households and firms want to make\nmore transactions, and hence need more currency. Figure 3 shows that the Fed’s currency outstand-\ning has grown smoothly over time as the U.S. economy has expanded, and now stands at about\n$1.6 trillion, or nearly 8% of gross domestic product (GDP). Of course, a variety of factors other\nthan economic growth, such as foreign demand for U.S. currency, have also affected the amount\nof currency outstanding. (We explore these factors in more detail in another Chicago Fed Letter.)\n\nElectronic liabilities to non-Treasury entities\nAlthough paper money is a convenient way to pay for small transactions, the costs of counting,\ntransporting, and safeguarding currency make it impractical to use for larger payments. (A million\ndollars in $100 bills—the largest denomination currently issued—weighs 22 pounds.) When banks\nmake large payments to each other, therefore, they do so electronically, using accounts at the Fed.\nThe Fed provides bank accounts to depository institutions, including commercial banks, savings\nbanks, credit unions, and savings and loan associations (thrifts). Depository institutions are legally\nrequired to hold a certain amount of reserves either in these electronic Fed accounts or as cash in\ntheir vaults. If a bank keeps more money in its Fed account than is legally required, the additional\nfunds are considered excess reserves. Depositories earn interest from the Fed on both required\nand excess reserves.5\nWhen one bank wants to make a payment to another bank, the paying bank instructs the Fed to\ntransfer reserves from its reserve account to the reserve account of the receiving bank. This system\nalso makes it possible for individuals and businesses to make large payments through their banks,\nby having their banks send payment instructions through the Fed, a process known as a wire transfer.\nIn addition to bank reserves, the Fed has various other electronic liabilities that are held by banks,\ncertain other financial institutions, and foreign governments that wish to have a reserve of U.S.\ndollars. For example, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and designated financial market\nutilities (DFMUs) keep accounts at the Fed. GSEs are financial intermediaries chartered by the\nfederal government that primarily facilitate the flow of credit to housing and agriculture. Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks are all GSEs. FMUs provide the infrastructure\nfor transferring, clearing, and settling payments, securities, and other financial transactions.6 The\nFinancial Stability Oversight Committee has designated as systemically important eight FMUs whose\nfailure or disruption could threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system. These DFMUs include\nthe Clearing House Interbank Payments System and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Federal\nReserve is authorized to pay interest on the accounts of DFMUs7 but not on the accounts of GSEs.\nThe electronic liabilities of banks, other financial institutions, and foreign governments all serve\nessentially the same purposes as paper currency—they allow entities outside the U.S. Treasury to\neasily make payments and to save their money in the form of dollars. Figure 3 plots the historical\nsize of reserves and other electronic liabilities against the size of currency. Historically, reserves\nand other electronic liabilities were only a tiny part of the Fed’s balance sheet. However, when the\nFed made large-scale asset purchases to stimulate the economy during and after the financial crisis,\nit paid for these purchases by creating bank reserves. The resulting expansion of the Fed’s balance\nsheet thus entailed a rapid increase in the quantity of electronic liabilities. As illustrated in figure\n3, these liabilities now stand at nearly $3 trillion, almost twice the value of currency in circulation.\nThe capital stock\nThe Fed’s assets—mainly Treasury and mortgage-backed securities—total $4.407 trillion, while its\nliabilities to the private sector and the Treasury total $4.368 trillion. The bulk of the difference is\nthe Fed’s capital stock, currently at $39 billion.8\nThe capital stock has two components. First, commercial banks that are members of the Federal\nReserve System are required to pay into the Fed’s capital in proportion to the capital they them-\nselves hold. Second, while the Fed remits virtually all of the earnings on its assets to the Treasury,\nit historically has retained some earnings as capital. Until 2015, the retained surplus was set equal\nto the capital paid in by commercial banks. Thus, the Fed’s total capital—the amount paid in by\ncommercial banks plus the retained surplus—grew in proportion to the size of the banking system,\n\n4.

However, in 2015 Congress passed a law limiting the Fed’s surplus to $10 billion,\nand in February 2018, Congress further reduced the limit to $7.5 billion. To comply with the limit,\nthe Fed transferred some of its surplus to the Treasury, reducing the amount of total capital. Going\nforward, the retained surplus will remain at $7.5 billion, while capital paid in by commercial banks\nwill continue to reflect the size of the banking system.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have described the Fed’s four major categories of liabilities: liabilities to the\nfederal government, electronic liabilities to other entities, currency, and the capital stock. In\nanother Chicago Fed Letter, we examine the outlook for currency and how it may affect the total\nsize of the Fed’s balance sheet.\n1 We thank Katerina Powers for excellent research assistance.\n2 Paul J.

Carpenter,” press release, Washington, DC, May 6, available online, https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/\npress-releases/Pages/jl10045.aspx.\n4 Historically, the U.S. Treasury also issued paper currency; a small quantity of this money is still in circulation and remains\nlegal tender, but none has been issued since 1971. Coins are a liability of the Treasury rather than the Fed.\n5 In addition to these interest-bearing accounts, the Fed provides additional services to banks, such as access to payment\nservices and the option to borrow from the Fed via the discount window (typically on an overnight basis).\n6 More information is available online, https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/designated_fmu_about.htm.\n7 More information is available online, https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/reghh-about.htm.\n8 The difference between assets and liabilities also includes several small items—deferred availability cash items, accrued\ndividends, and miscellaneous other liabilities—which total $7 billion as of March 14, 2018.\n\nCharles L.

It is my distinct pleasure to welcome you\nto the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and to our Ninth Annual Fintech\nConference.\nAs we begin the conference, I’d like to share my perspectives — and some of the\nquestions that I am grappling with as we consider the conference theme: how to\nharness the benefits and mind the risks of fintech innovations.\nThese are of course my own views, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or my Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) colleagues.\nAs I look around this room, I’m struck by the extraordinary depth and diversity of\nexpertise assembled here today. Technologists and bankers, regulators and\nentrepreneurs, academics and investors, consumer advocates, and policymakers — all\nunited by a shared interest in the future of finance.\nThis diversity is not incidental to our purpose but essential to it. We are gathered at an\nimportant inflection point in the evolution of our financial system. The rapid convergence\nof cutting-edge technologies with traditional financial infrastructure creates\nunprecedented opportunities and equally significant challenges that no single\nperspective can address.\nConsider the transformation we’ve witnessed in just the past decade. Mobile payments\nhave evolved from novelty to necessity. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are\nrevolutionizing everything from credit decisions to fraud detection. Open banking is\nredefining the relationship between financial institutions and customers. Embedded\nfinance is blurring the very definition of what constitutes a financial service.\n1 Julapa Jagtiani, senior economic advisor and economist I, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/julapa-jagtiani.\n\nAnd importantly, cryptocurrencies and digital assets have moved from the fringe to the\ncenter — including to the center of legislative and central banking discussions.\nAs I think about this inflection point, I find it helpful to consider the opportunities and the\nchallenges it offers from the vantage of the past and the future. What lessons does\nhistory provide to help us navigate the present? And what grade will the future give to\nour navigation skills?\nStarting with the past, I dusted off my undergraduate copy of Schumpeter’s Capitalism,\nSocialism and Democracy.2 It’s a long book, but the insight that has had a lasting impact\nis, to put it in Schumpeter’s words: “Creative destruction is the essential fact about\ncapitalism.”\nFrom this perspective, what we are witnessing is business as usual: new ideas replace\nold ones. There are winners and losers, of course, but, as one essay sums it up: “Over\ntime, societies that allow creative destruction to operate grow more productive and\nricher; their citizens see the benefits of new and better products . . . better jobs, and\nhigher living standards.”3\nThis might have surprised Schumpeter. He was actually pretty gloomy about creative\ndestruction and the prospects for enduring capitalism. In the same book that has earned\nhim the label of the prophet of innovation, he says: “Can capitalism survive? No. I do not\nthink it can.” Interestingly, he thinks that capitalism will falter not because it leads to\neconomic failure but because its success will ultimately undermine it.\nOne source of failure that Schumpeter worries about is that successful firms will get big\nand bureaucratic and will lose their entrepreneurial edge. But that’s actually not what\nwe’ve seen.\nStudying sources of innovation in the U.S. nonfarm private sector from 1983 to 2013,\nresearchers find that about 25 percent of innovation comes from what we would call\ncreative destruction, and the vast majority comes from improvements that existing firms\nmake to their own products and services.\nOf particular relevance for fintech innovation, the share of innovation from creative\ndestruction was higher in the fast-growing information technology and communications\nspace over its peak innovation period. Even here, the authors find that most innovation\ncame from existing firms.4\n2 Schumpeter, Joseph. Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. London: Routledge, 1976.\n3 Alm, Richard and W. Michael Cox. “Creative Destruction,” Econlib,\nhttps://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html.\n4 Garcia-Macia, Daniel, Chang-Tai Hsieh, Peter J. Klenow. “How Destructive Is Innovation?” Econometrica, 87:5,\nSeptember 2019, pp. 1507–1541, http://klenow.com/DestructiveInnovation_GHK.pdf; Laidler, John. “Does Creative\nDestruction Really Drive Economic Growth? Summary of Working Paper 22953,” The NBER Digest, February 2017,\nhttps://www.nber.org/digest/feb17/does-creative-destruction-really-drive-economic-growth.\n2\n\nSo, two lessons that I take away from this brief, and admittedly selective, review of\nhistory are: Number one, don’t get in the way of progress; and number two, there’s a lot\nof creativity that can happen without destruction. Traditional financial firms have an\nimportant role to play in driving financial innovation.\nWhat about the future? At this inflection point, where the frameworks and the rules of\nthe game for fintech are being established, how should their future success be\nevaluated?\nWill we measure success by the volume of transactions processed through new\nplatforms? By the market valuations of fintech unicorns? By the regulatory frameworks\nwe establish? These are important indicators, certainly, but insufficient.\nThe innovations that we are witnessing hold tremendous promise. They can expand\naccess to financial services for the historically unbanked. They can reduce costs and\nfriction in transactions across borders. They can improve transparency and security in\nour markets.\nAlongside these opportunities lie substantial risks that demand our attention. Issues of\ndata privacy and security grow more complex with each technological advance. The\nacceleration of financial transactions creates new vectors for systemic risk.\nAlgorithmic decision-making raises important questions about fairness, bias, and\naccountability. And as financial services become more digitized, we must ensure that\nthey don’t leave behind those with limited technological access or literacy.\nSo, a fundamental question is: How will we know if we’ve succeeded in harnessing the\nbenefits of fintech innovation while adequately addressing its risks?\nFirst of all, we know it is possible for fintech innovations to simultaneously create wins\nfor traditional financial firms, fintech firms, and consumers. In one Philly Fed study,\nresearchers found that banks who partnered with fintechs were able to offer larger credit\nlines to customers with low or missing credit scores, and they actually got better at\nassessing credit risk. The results were especially apparent in the mortgage sector. 5\nAnd a study out of India showed that the introduction of broadband networks and a\nnationwide digital payment system that created verifiable transaction histories has\nsignificantly expanded access to credit at scale, particularly among subprime borrowers\n5 Jagtiani, Julapa et al. “Fintech Innovations in Banking: Fintech Partnership and Default Rate on Bank Loans,”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, July 1, 2025, https://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/banking-and-\nfinancial-markets/fintech-innovations-in-banking-fintech-partnership-and-default-rate-on-bank-loans.\n3\n\nand those with thin credit histories. Fintech firms led the way on these initiatives, and,\nso far, credit growth has not come at the cost of higher default rates.6\nIn the U.S., we have a very diverse financial system — with community banks and\nmega banks operating side by side in a way that provides many options to consumers\nand businesses. And consumers have diverse needs: some are hungry for traditional\nfinancial institutions to integrate crypto trading into their platforms, and others would be\nhappy never knowing what the word “blockchain” means.\nFinancial innovation isn’t always digital. Here in the Third District, one community bank\nhas designed its drive-through lanes to accommodate the horse and buggy\ntransportation of the Amish community. They also have mobile banking units that help to\naddress this community’s banking needs in a way that honors their beliefs.7\nJust as innovation can come from both new fintechs and the traditional financial sector,\nas well as from partnerships between them, we don’t need to start from scratch when it\ncomes to regulatory structures.\nWhile no regulatory approach is perfect — and they all need to evolve — we have\nlearned a lot over the years about how, and how not, to safeguard consumers and the\npayments system, to prevent financial instability, and to ensure safe and sound lending.\nThere are likely to be important aspects of our current regulatory structure that we can\nbuild on and others that will require new approaches.\nSo, what does this tell us about how what we do today should be evaluated in the\nfuture? Success will mean financial inclusion is broadened; that products and services\nexpand to meet the diverse needs of households and businesses. Success will mean\nregulatory structures that recognize that traditional finance and fintech need to coexist in\none financial system and that the boundaries between them are likely to be fluid.\nSuccess will mean regulatory structures that do their best to avoid the mistakes of the\npast and build on what has worked. Success will mean financial firms continue to\ninnovate, create value, and meet consumer needs. Ultimately, success will mean that\nwe have harnessed the benefits of creative destruction and built a stable financial\nsystem that makes future generations better off.\nSo that’s a pretty high standard. And that’s precisely why gatherings like this conference\nare so crucial.\n6 Alok, Shashwat et al. “Breaking Barriers to Financial Access: Cross-Platform Digital Payments and Credit Markets,”\nNBER, December 23, 2024, https://www.nber.org/papers/w33259\n7 Barca, Alaina and Crystal Flynn. “When ‘Mobile’ Means Buses or a Horse and Buggy: Innovative Solutions to\nBanking Deserts,” Fed Communities, April 2, 2024, https://fedcommunities.org/innovative-solutions-banking-deserts/.\n4\n\nThis standard can’t be met by technologists alone, nor by financial experts, nor by\nregulators acting in isolation. Achieving this standard requires the kind of sustained\ncross-disciplinary collaboration that happens when diverse stakeholders come together\nwith openness and common purpose.\nAnd that is the reason for this conference. When a cybersecurity expert can engage\ndirectly with a consumer advocate; when market regulators can talk directly with bank\nregulators; when a seasoned veteran of market crashes can share lessons learned with\na fintech CEO — that is when we begin to develop solutions that are both innovative\nand responsible and that can stand up to the scrutiny of future generations.\nI want to thank the conference organizers — Bill,8 Julapa, and the team, as well as our\npartners from the Wharton School, the School of International and Public Affairs at\nColumbia University, the University of Cambridge, and the Brookings Institution — for\ncreating such a rich and dynamic event.\nI’d also like to express my appreciation for the distinguished speakers we’ll hear from\nover the next two days, and to all of you joining us, whether you’re here in person or\nwatching online. Over the years, this event has earned a reputation for open, rigorous\ndebate — and that’s what we need – and I’m sure this year will be no different.\nNow I have the honor of introducing my colleagues, Federal Reserve Board Governor\nChristopher Waller and the Federal Reserve System’s Chief Innovation Officer Sunayna\nTuteja.\nGovernor Waller has been a member of the Federal Reserve Board since December of\n2020. I first got to know Chris when he was the research director at the St. Louis Fed. At\nthat time, he had, in addition to many other noteworthy responsibilities, the important job\nof closing the special door to the FOMC meeting room after Chairman Bernanke\nentered. I am glad to say that Chris’s talents are now being used to open doors to\ndialogue, collaboration, and innovation that drive efficiency, resilience, and progress.\nSunayna joined the Federal Reserve System in 2021 as its first chief innovation officer.\nShe spent many years driving change and innovation in finance, technology, and policy,\nincluding here in Philadelphia during her time at TD.

That’s\nwhy I feel such a strong connection to NABE and the work that you all do.\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve System is committed to serving the public by\nfostering conditions that lead to stable prices and maximum employment. As president\nof the Philadelphia Fed, I look deeply and widely at the economic data and complement\nthat with perspectives I’ve gained from talking directly with people in the communities\nwe serve.\nThose conversations allow me to bring regional insights to our broader analysis of the\neconomy and monetary policy. And they help me to keep front of mind the ways in\nwhich Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions impact all of us.\nI’m looking forward to talking with Greg and taking your questions. But first, I’d like to\ntake some time up front to describe how I see the economy and what I believe this\nmeans for monetary policy.\nAnd, before I do that, let me emphasize that the views that I express today are mine and\nnot necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the FOMC.\nLet’s jump right in. The latest available data suggest an economy that is doing pretty\nwell, although inflation remains elevated.\nEconomic activity generally came in above expectations over the summer, with a strong\nshowing from the U.S. consumer as well as strength in business investment. After\ndeclining in the first quarter, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a 3.8 percent\n1 Gregory Daco, vice president, NABE Board of Directors, and chief economist, EY.\n\nannual rate in the second quarter and early indications are that above trend growth will\ncontinue in the third quarter as well.\nThe unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in August, near what I would characterize as\nfull employment. But unemployment is up from 4.1 percent in June, and the August\nemployment report suggests that momentum in the labor market is to the downside.\nJob gains have slowed markedly but labor supply and demand appear to be slowing\nmore or less in tandem, leaving overall conditions in a rough balance. I am hearing\nsimilar sentiments from employers who can find workers when they need them but\ngenerally describe being in a low-hire, low-fire stance.\nTotal Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation came in at 2.7 percent year\nover year in August and core PCE was a little higher at 2.9 percent. While inflation\ncontinues to be above 2 percent, it is down significantly from pandemic highs.\nAnd this process has come with an assist from restrictive monetary policy. With the\nfederal funds rate currently at 4 to 4-and-a-quarter percent, I see policy as modestly\nrestrictive now.\nLet me spend a minute describing how I think about tariffs and inflation. My base case is\nthat tariffs will increase the price level, but they won’t leave a lasting imprint on inflation.\nAnd, given this base case, monetary policy should look through tariff effects on prices.\nWhy? Let me start with the economics. Here the lessons from economic theory are\nclear: So long as inflation expectations are anchored, increases in prices due to supply\neffects do not turn into an inflation problem.\nGoing beyond the theory, the data so far have largely been consistent with this view. We\nare definitely seeing the effects of tariffs in the inflation data — the increase in goods\nprice inflation is clear.\nBut relative to what our analysis predicted, tariff-induced price increases have been\nsomewhat smaller than anticipated. Now, we have seen some strength in service prices\nas well, and this bears watching — it would be a problem if tariff induced price increases\nspill over to inflation more generally. That said, I don’t see conditions as supporting\nproblematic spillovers.\nFirst, labor market conditions are very different than they were during the pandemic\nwhen turnover was elevated and workers were job hopping to get higher wages. Some\nof my contacts have described lowering starting wages, for example. This is not what I\nwould expect to hear if the labor market was going to be a force that accelerated\ninflation.\n2\n\nSecond, many firms report being focused on preserving market share and this makes\nthem motivated to find creative ways to avoid passing on increased costs. Finally,\nmonetary policy is modestly restrictive and has been restrictive for some time.\nThe flip side of the famous “long and variable lags” axiom is that the effects of past\npolicy persist over time. For me, the bottom line is that I simply don’t see the type of\nconditions, especially in the labor market, which seem likely to turn tariff-induced price\nincreases into sustained inflation.\nBut I reach this conclusion with an awareness that we need to be careful. We have\nheard a lot about how uncertainty is delaying some investment projects — when there is\ngreater clarity, we might see a burst of growth.\nAnd after four plus years of above-target inflation, it’s important to consider the\nramifications. Firms have had a lot of practice raising prices and consumers have had to\nget used to a lot of price increases as well.\nMy own research has focused on how living through things like financial crises can\nimpact future behavior, so I am sympathetic to the idea that the experiences of the last\nfour years may have left an enduring legacy and that is another reason to proceed\ncautiously.\nI do still expect some additional goods inflation over the next few quarters, due in part to\ncurrent tariffs working their way through and also to new tariffs that have been\nannounced. This combination of new and old does complicate the exercise, so let me\nshare an analogy that has helped me.\nSome of you may be familiar with the children’s book Lowly Worm Meets the Early Bird\nby Richard Scarry. If you aren’t, I highly recommend it, along with everything else by\nRichard Scarry!\nLowly is a dapper worm who wears a hat, a bow tie and, naturally, a single shoe. At one\npoint in the story, Lowly and Early Bird are having a meal. Lowly is eating peas, and you\ncan clearly see the imprint of each pea on his long body. But when you turn the page,\nLowly is back to his usual slim self. The peas have been digested and left no lasting\nimprint. That’s my base case on tariffs and inflation. But Lowly worm is eating a lot of\npeas, so we need to keep a close eye on him to make sure he doesn’t get indigestion.\nGiven my views on tariffs and inflation, monetary policy should be focused on balancing\nrisks to maximum employment and price stability which means moving policy towards a\nmore neutral stance.\nWhy? First, because of the progress on underlying inflation, excluding the effects of\ntariffs. Ignoring this could add unnecessary stress to the labor market. Second, labor\nmarket risks do appear to be increasing — not outrageously, but noticeably. And\nmomentum seems to be going in the wrong direction.\n3\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the FOMC’s decision to cut rates by 25 basis points in\nSeptember made sense. Over the rest of this year, I view easing along the lines of the\nmedian Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) policy path as appropriate. Of course,\nthat is if economic and financial conditions evolve as I expect. And I’ll return to that “if” in\na moment.\nBut first, what about next year? I see two important questions for monetary policy to\ngrapple with in 2026. The first question is: What is the neutral policy rate? And the\nsecond question is: How quickly should policy move to neutral? My short answer to\nthese questions is: I don’t know, and because I don’t know, we should proceed\ncautiously.\nTo expand on this just a little bit, there are a wide range of plausible estimates of the\nneutral policy rate, and I think we will need to feel our way there, paying close attention\nto what economic developments tell us about the stance of policy.\nThe ability to go slowly and assess is particularly valuable as we get closer to neutral.\nWe will be better positioned to go slowly in the future if we adjust policy in the near term\nin a way that better aligns labor market and inflation risks.\nI anticipate that 2026 will see growth near potential, and inflation rising and then\nsubsiding as tariffs, together with current and past monetary policy restrictiveness, work\ntheir way through.\nIf the economy evolves as I expect, the monetary policy adjustments we make this year\nand next will be sufficient to keep labor market conditions close to full employment.\n“If the economy evolves as I expect” is doing a lot of work here. I am particularly\nfocused on the breadth of support for growth, and I see some reasons to think that it\nmight be somewhat narrow, and this could make the economy vulnerable to shocks.\nTo start with, virtually all of the net job growth we’ve seen this year has been confined to\nhealth care and social assistance. Employment in most other sectors has been flat to\ndown on the year.2\nConsumption, the largest component of GDP, has proven “resilient” again and again.\nHowever, there are reasons to examine the breadth of support for consumer demand\nas well.\nI have been hearing from many contacts that households, particularly at the lower end\nof the income distribution, are feeling the weight of higher prices and slower wage\n2 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. n.d. “Employment by Industry: Monthly Changes.” Accessed October 12,\n2025. https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-by-industry-monthly-changes.htm.\nThe net job creation since December 2024 is 590K, with private education and health care sectors\ncontributing 521K jobs. Calculations based on the provided data.\n4\n\ngrowth. In response, they have been adjusting discretionary spending, and often\n“trading down” to lower cost alternatives to preserve cash flow.\nWith lower-income consumers more constrained, spending by high-income households\nmay be even more important than usual. Indeed, recent analysis suggests that\nconsumption is growing considerably faster among high-income households compared\nto medium- to low-income households. That means aggregate consumption growth is\nmore dependent than usual on higher-income households.3\nSo, what is driving spending growth among higher income consumers? The top 20\npercent of households by income own over 85 percent of corporate equity, so it is not\nsurprising that spending by high-income households is linked to the fortunes of the\nstock market.4 And the stock market has mostly been on a tear.\nHowever, this performance has been largely driven by just a handful of firms, and the\nmarket has been quite sensitive to the narrative around artificial intelligence (AI). It\nseems likely that AI will eventually have profound impacts on all aspects of the\neconomy, but where we are currently seeing a lot of the action is in the stock market.\nThis might all turn out great. And I see tremendous promise in how AI may eventually\nboost productivity. But in the more immediate term, the relatively narrow base of support\nfor the labor market, the importance of high-income consumers together with the\nprominence of the narrative around AI for equities, adds up to a relatively narrow base\nof support for growth over the next year or so. Indeed, some business contacts are\nwondering where future demand will come from. This is something to watch closely.\nLet me make a final point about inflation. Over the past four years, long-run inflation\nexpectations from market measures have remained remarkably stable. Over this period,\nwe’ve seen headline PCE inflation of over 7 percent and big increases in shorter run\ninflation expectations.\nThe stability of longer run inflation expectations is an important testament to the\ncredibility of monetary policy and to the value of that credibility. Even during the largest\nrun-up in inflation in over 40 years, markets overwhelmingly had faith that the Fed would\nreturn inflation to 2 percent over a reasonable timeframe.\n3 Wallace, Alicia. \"The Impact of the K-Shaped Economy on US Spending Habits.\" CNN, September 18,\n2025. https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/business/us-k-shaped-economy-spending; Bhattarai, Abha. \"The\nwealthiest are boosting the economy, as consumer spending rises again.\" The Washington Post,\nSeptember 26, 2025. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/26/wealthy-spending-economy-\nconsumers/.\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2025. \"Financial Accounts of the United States -\nZ.1 - Current Release.\" Accessed October 8, 2025.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/default.htm; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem. 2022. \"Survey of Consumer Finances.\" Accessed October 8, 2025.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm.\n5\n\nThat credibility, in turn, has been key to enabling the FOMC to bring inflation down a lot,\nwhile keeping the labor market at levels close to full employment. But it’s critical to finish\nthe job and return inflation all the way to 2 percent.\nCredibility is a hard-won asset that allows us to fight inflation, while preserving the labor\nmarket strength that benefits all Americans.\nThank you so much and I look forward to continuing the conversation with Greg and to\nyour questions.\n6",

For those I haven’t met yet —\nwelcome! I’m looking forward to getting to know you in the months ahead.\nThis year marks a special milestone. It’s the 80th anniversary of the Field Meeting\nseries.\nSince I am new to the Philly Fed, I’ve been asking a lot of questions about things that\nother people take for granted. When I first saw the name “field meeting,” I didn’t get the\nconnection with banking, so I did some digging. And our 1946 annual report provides a\nclue to the origins of these meetings. It describes the development of “a program of\nconferences with bankers in the field.”2\nLooking back to the time of the very first field meetings, in many ways things couldn’t be\nmore different than they are now. Banking was done face-to-face. Folks tracked the\nbalance in their savings accounts in passbooks.\n1 Joe Budash, senior manager and advisor, financial institutions relations, Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia, https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/joe-budash.\n2 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 1946, Early Fruits of Victory: Thirty-Second Annual Report of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\nAnd FDIC deposit insurance was barely 10 years old. And it covered a whopping $2,500\nper depositor (that’s the equivalent of about $45,000 today, lest you think I am going to\nforget about inflation!).\nWhile banking has evolved quite a bit over the past 80 years, one constant has been\nthe ongoing and productive relationships we have with you — the financial institutions\nacross our District. From the very beginning, Philly Fed staff recognized the value of\nopen and direct lines of communication with the broad range of constituents we serve.\nThat annual report I mentioned also touted the field meetings as opportunities to “not\nonly to discuss current problems of mutual interest but also to seek solutions to these\nproblems through cooperative efforts.”\nAnd these relationships go beyond our role in supervision. They help us to tailor\ninformation and programming to your needs, like the fraud protection resources Jeanne3\ntalked about. They showcase the many ways that you support your communities. And\nour dialogues help me to understand our regional economy and are an important input\nto how I think about monetary policy.\nSince starting my job as president of the Philadelphia Fed in July, I’ve made it a priority\nto get out into the District to hear directly from community members, nonprofits, banks,\nand businesses. These conversations give me rich insights into evolving economic and\nfinancial conditions.\nOne of the most valuable things for me is that these conversations help me understand\nthe broad range of economic conditions and experiences in our District. For example, in\none conversation, I heard about workers struggling to find jobs and, in another, I heard\nabout employers struggling to keep workers because of the high cost of housing.\nAnd I also hear about creative solutions — converting a vacant Poconos hotel into\nhousing for seasonal workers, for example. And a program in Southern New Jersey\n3 Jeanne R. Rentezelas, first vice president and chief operating officer, Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia, https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/rentezelas-jeanne-r.\n2\n\npivoted from training workers for offshore wind positions to training them to work safely\nat heights, opening up opportunities in firefighting and construction.\nOne thing that’s stood out in my conversations across the District, with all of you, but\nalso in conversations with business and nonprofit leaders, is the central role that\ncommunity banks play in the economy. So, I’m not surprised by the findings of one\nstudy, which shows that places with a greater community bank presence are better able\nto weather economic ups and downs and were less susceptible to job losses during the\nGreat Recession.4\nCommunity banks are an enduring part of the financial landscape, but there’s also been\nlots of change. Over the last several months, I’ve heard concerns about fast moving\nfintech developments and the potential for stablecoins, in particular, to compete directly\nwith traditional bank deposits.\nI’ve heard a range of very thoughtful comments from community bankers about\nelements they would like to see in emerging legal and regulatory frameworks. I have\nalso heard from those, including community bankers, who are excited to use these new\ntechnologies. These are complex issues that require robust conversations.\nLast week we hosted our Ninth Annual Fintech Conference. The goal of that conference\nis to provide a forum for exactly that kind of robust conversation and to make sure that it\nincludes a range of perspectives — small and large banks, fintech innovators, banking\nand market regulators, as well as experts and practitioners.\nWhile the prevailing concern I’ve heard from most of you is wanting a level playing field\nin which to compete, fintech innovations can also create win-win-win situations for\nfintechs, traditional financial firms, and consumers.\n4 Luke Petach, Stephan Weiler, and Tessa Conroy, 2021, “It’s a Wonderful Loan: Local Financial\nComposition, Community Banks, and Economic Resilience,” Journal of Banking & Finance 126,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2021.106077.\n3\n\nOne Philly Fed study found that banks who partnered with fintechs were able to offer\nlarger credit lines to customers with low or missing credit scores, and the banks actually\ngot better at assessing credit risk. The results were especially pronounced in the\nmortgage sector.5\nThe United States is relatively unique — with community banks and large banks, and\nincreasingly fintechs coexisting side-by-side. This diverse landscape provides a wealth\nof options for consumers and for businesses.\nOne distinct advantage community banks have is that you are well positioned to tailor\nproducts and services to your customers’ needs and to innovate in ways that make\nsense for them. And innovations don’t always have to be digital. Here in our District, the\nBank of Bird-in-Hand has expanded its drive-through lanes so they can handle horse\nand buggy traffic and better serve their Amish customers.\nOur commitment at the Philly Fed is to continue the tradition that began 80 years ago of\ninvesting in deep relationships with banks in our region. The 1946 annual report put it\nwell: “not only to discuss current problems of mutual interest but also to seek solutions\nto these problems through cooperative efforts.”\nNow, I’d like to use my remaining time to offer a brief overview of how I see the\neconomy and what that means for monetary policy. But, before I get into that, let me\nremind everyone that I am speaking just for myself and the views that I express today\nare not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nI will start by noting that it was great to get the September labor market report this\nmorning and that I’m eager for the regular flow of official data to resume so we can best\nassess economic conditions.\n5 Julapa Jagtiani, Catharine Lemieux, and Brandon Goldstein, 2025, “Fintech Innovations in Banking:\nFintech Partnership and Default Rate on Bank Loans,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/the-economy/banking-and-financial-markets/fintech-innovations-in-\nbanking-fintech-partnership-and-default-rate-on-bank-loans.\n4\n\nWhile the information that I get from conversations with you and other contacts is\nalways valuable, it is especially so now. We also make use of a wide range of data that\nwe collect ourselves or get from the private sector.\nSo, despite the lack of official data, we are getting a lot of information about how\neconomic conditions are evolving. But there really isn’t a good substitute for official\ndata, especially on inflation. The available data and conversations that I am having with\na range of contacts suggest that the economy is doing “okay.”\nAggregate spending surprised to the upside over the summer — the U.S. consumer has\nbeen resilient. But, despite this resilience, consumer sentiment is very low.\nAnd, while higher-income consumers are doing quite well, lower- and moderate-income\nhouseholds are struggling. We see this in the data and hear it from a range of contacts.\nCredit card data show that for lower-income consumers real spending has been\nrelatively flat while the spending of higher-income consumers continues to grow.6\nConversations this week suggested that this bifurcation may have intensified in recent\nweeks. Competition for value is fierce, and one convenience store chain is discounting\ntake-away meals to keep customers. And consumers continue to look for value in other\nways with store brands gaining market share over name brands.\nCandy sales over Halloween provide another example of how stretched some families\nare. Smaller bags of candy — with fewer items — sold better than larger bags that\noffered greater value per unit. And, at the same time, demand for higher-end chocolate\nis very strong.\n6 Rees Hagler and Dhiren Patki, 2025, “Why Has Consumer Spending Remained So Resilient? Evidence\nfrom Credit Card Data,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, accessed November 20, 2025,\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current-policy-perspectives/2025/why-has-consumer-spending-\nremained-resilient.aspx.\n5\n\nAll of this means that aggregate consumption growth is more dependent than usual on\nthe highest earners.7 This creates a somewhat narrow base for economic growth and\nmay make the growth outlook particularly sensitive to equity valuations.\nThe top 20 percent of households by income own over 85 percent of corporate equity,\nso their spending is linked to the fortunes of the stock market.8 And while the stock\nmarket has mostly been on a tear, it’s also been very sensitive to the narrative around\nartificial intelligence (AI).\nShifting to the labor market, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 percent in\nSeptember from 4.3 percent in August, still in the neighborhood of full employment. I\nusually focus on the quarterly pattern in labor market data because job gains can move\naround a lot from month to month. Indeed, in August jobs declined by 4,000 and, in\nSeptember, that flipped and 119,000 jobs were created.\nOn balance, I view the data for September as encouraging. Taking a step back from the\nrecent monthly data, over the year, we’ve seen job gains slow substantially, but labor\nsupply has been declining, too.\nWith demand and supply slowing more or less in tandem, the labor market has stayed\nroughly in balance. Consistent with that view, in recent roundtables, community bankers\nhave reported that labor markets are in better balance and that upward wage pressure\nhas subsided. Although they noted that in some regions there are still positions that are\nhard to fill such as teller roles and, for businesses, skilled trade workers remain in\ndemand.\nOur monthly business outlook surveys have also been pointing to somewhat weaker but\nreasonably steady labor market conditions. Although, there was a small uptick in\n7 Alicia Wallace, \"The Impact of the K-Shaped Economy on US Spending Habits,\" CNN, September 18,\n2025, https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/business/us-k-shaped-economy-spending; Abha Bhattarai, \"The\nwealthiest are boosting the economy, as consumer spending rises again,\" The Washington Post,\nSeptember 26, 2025, https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/26/wealthy-spending-economy-\nconsumers/.\n8 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2025, “Distributional Financial Accounts,” accessed\nNovember 20, 2025, https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/index.html.\n6\n\nOctober in the share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting declining employment.\nHowever, virtually all of the net job growth we’ve seen this year through September has\nbeen concentrated in healthcare and social assistance.\nEmployment in most other sectors has been flat to down on the year.9 Historically, when\njob gains are concentrated in acyclical sectors like healthcare, that is a precursor to a\nslowdown. So, I continue to see labor market risks as tilted to the downside.\nTurning to inflation, CPI inflation was 3 percent on a year-over-year basis in September.\nTariffs are pushing goods inflation up and I expect that to continue as they work their\nway through to final goods prices.\nAnd other components of inflation are also a little elevated as well. My base case is that\ntariffs will increase prices but that they won’t lead to an ongoing inflation problem. So\nfar, the evidence is consistent with this view, but it will take time to fully confirm or refute\nit.\nDuring my meetings with community bankers, I’ve heard a lot about how trade policies\nare impacting your customers and local economies. Although some businesses have\nseen large negative impacts and others have been winners, for the most part, these\nconversations suggest that tariff effects have been smaller than feared. This is, in part,\nbecause businesses are finding creative ways to manage the impact of tariffs and that\nhas limited price increases.\nThe overall demand environment is contributing to keeping a lid on inflation as well —\nwith the labor market in balance and many consumers looking for bargains, businesses\nare cautious about increasing prices. That said, I do view risks to inflation as tilted to the\nupside, particularly as we are on track for five years of inflation above 2 percent.\n9 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Employment by Industry: Monthly Changes,” accessed November 20,\n2025, https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-by-industry-monthly-changes.htm.\n7\n\nSo, with upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment, monetary policy\nhas to walk a fine line. In my judgement, the 25-basis-point rate cuts at the September\nand October meetings were appropriate and have helped to keep policy on that line. But\neach rate cut raises the bar for the next cut. And that’s because each rate cut brings us\ncloser to the level where policy flips from restraining activity a bit to the place where it is\nproviding a boost. So, I am approaching the December FOMC cautiously.\nOn the margin, I’m still a little more worried about the labor market than I am about\ninflation, but I expect to learn a lot between now and the next meeting. And, as I think\nabout monetary policy over the longer arc, I’ll be focused on how to appropriately\nbalance the risks to both inflation and the labor market, guided by my commitment to\ndeliver on the FOMC’s price stability mandate and get inflation all the way back to 2\npercent.\nWith a week to go before Thanksgiving, I’d like to talk now about a couple of things that\nI am grateful for, starting with Tony Ibargüen. Tony is the chair of the Philly Fed’s board\nof directors. Tony’s term concludes at the end of the year. And I want to thank Tony for\nall that he has done to support me and to support the Bank’s engagement efforts and for\nhis help in building and strengthening relationships across our District. Thank you, Tony,\nfor your public service, for your ongoing collaboration, and for spending this evening\nwith us. Please join me in acknowledging Tony.\nI’d also like to thank all of you for sharing your insights. They are essential to me and\nthe great team of experts at the Reserve Bank. We look forward to hearing from you\nthroughout the year. You are positioned to see momentum shifts in the economy before\nthey show up in the data. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you see things shifting.\nWe also welcome your questions and feedback and recommendations for new research\nor programming.\nThank you all for your partnership and best wishes for the holiday season.\n8",

Good afternoon, everyone! I am delighted to\nwelcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s 13th biennial conference on\nhousehold finance and consumer payments.\nThis year holds special significance because we are celebrating 25 years of the\nConsumer Finance Institute’s leadership in consumer credit and payments research. I’m\ngoing to brag a little bit about the Consumer Finance Institute and talk about why its\nwork is so important.\nBut, before I do that, I need to remind you all that these are my own views and not\nnecessarily those of any of my Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) colleagues or\nanyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nTwenty-five years ago, when what became the Consumer Finance Institute was first\nestablished, the norm was to physically go to a bank branch to talk to a teller or to use\nan ATM. Virtually everyone paid monthly bills using checks and talked to a loan officer if\nthey needed a mortgage. The idea of getting investment advice from social media or\nusing a smartphone to pay for morning coffee was only a glimmer in the eye of the most\nardent futurists.\nAt that time, the Philadelphia Fed’s region — Delaware, the eastern two-thirds of\nPennsylvania, along with Southern New Jersey — was home to one of the largest PIN\ndebit networks in the country. And Philadelphia Fed staff processed millions of checks\nfrom families paying monthly credit card bills.\nThis made the Philly Fed a natural place to launch a center dedicated to advancing\nresearch on consumer credit and payments — areas of critical importance to so many\nfacets of the Fed’s work.\nOver time, the consumer credit and payments landscape has changed a great deal, with\ntechnological advances driving new forms of payment and reshaping entire industries.\n1 Robert Hunt, SVP and associate director, Consumer Finance Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\nThe Consumer Finance Institute has evolved to remain at the forefront of these\nchanges, work that has required more data-intensive strategies, new skills, and\nincreasingly greater computing resources.\nIn that evolution, the breadth of the Consumer Finance Institute expanded from a focus\non credit, debit, and prepaid cards to encompass virtually all forms of consumer credit\nand most forms of payments — old and new. What has stayed the same, however, is\nthe Institute’s goal of better understanding how people earn, save, and invest and what\ndrives their decisions. Understanding this behavior is vital to understanding the\neconomy as a whole.\nIt’s easy to see why. Consumer spending represents two-thirds of all economic activity.\nAnd the decisions individuals and families make about how much to spend, how much\nto borrow, and how much to save reflect many things — including the resources that\nthey have today, how optimistic they are about the future, and potential frictions in\nconsumer credit markets.\nUnderstanding consumer behavior helps me to better understand the broader economy\nand is an important input into my thinking about monetary policy. When we achieve our\ndual mandate goals of stable prices and maximum employment, it’s easier for families to\nplan and invest for the future and to make ends meet in the present. And, certainly, the\nstructure and efficiency of consumer credit markets impact the transmission of monetary\npolicy to the broader economy.\nConsumer finance is central to the Federal Reserve System’s major responsibilities —\nnot just to monetary policy. How people spend, save, and borrow is naturally influenced\nby monetary policy. But consumer finance also reflects the stability of our financial and\npayments systems, the efficacy of bank supervision, the enforcement of consumer\nprotection laws, and the Fed’s work to promote community development efforts.\nAs the financial system and the payment system evolve, new products and services\nbecome available, and others become less popular. Regardless of whether it’s paying\nfor a meal using a debit card, or using buy-now, pay-later to do holiday shopping, or\ninvesting in cryptocurrency, the Consumer Finance Institute team is on the frontlines\nassessing the latest developments. And they’re digging in to understand what they\nmight mean for the Fed with respect to our responsibilities for monetary policy, financial\nstability, bank supervision, consumer compliance, community development, and the\npayments system. But also — and entwined with these responsibilities — what new\ndevelopments mean for the well-being of households.\nThis conference encapsulates what the Institute does best: Bringing together\npolicymakers, regulators, researchers, and practitioners to deepen our knowledge and\nexpand our perspectives.\n2\n\nThese conferences, and the ongoing conversations we have with many of you\nthroughout the year, also inform our own evolving research priorities. Ultimately, our\ngoal is to drive a deeper understanding of the financial decisions that families make so\nwe can strengthen the economy and improve people’s lives.\nThere are a few key ingredients to the Consumer Finance Institute’s success over the\nyears: collaboration, deep expertise, and innovation. The focus on innovation means\nthat the Institute is now using the latest machine learning and big data techniques.\nI’d like to highlight a few examples of the team’s recent work. In a study released last\nDecember, Philly Fed researchers assembled a comprehensive data set on the financial\ncharacteristics of higher education institutions and used machine learning models to\npredict the probability of financial distress or closures among these institutions. 2\nConsolidation in higher ed can pose challenges for individual institutions and their\ncommunities as well as for students. The authors’ work has not only helped to answer\nimportant questions but also demonstrates the value of applying newer machine\nlearning tools as a complement to more traditional forecasting techniques.\nI’d also like to note the Labor, Income, Finances, and Expectations (LIFE) Survey. The\nLIFE Survey grew out of the consumer pulse survey that our team stood up at the\noutset of the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to stay on top of rapidly changing\nconsumer conditions during a very challenging time. The LIFE Survey has proven itself\nto be a rigorous and nimble tool that provides a reliable gauge of consumers’ economic\nand financial experiences as well as their outlook for the future.\nThe LIFE Survey has been a tremendous source of new consumer intel for both\nresearchers at the Philly Fed and beyond. Researchers at the Philly Fed, for example,\nhave used the data to explore a range of topics, including the rapidly evolving student\nloan market; the emergence of buy-now, pay-later programs; trends in home and auto\ninsurance markets; the evolution of sources of financial advice, and consumer attitudes\nrelated to crypto.\nJust this week, our researchers published a study using LIFE Survey data that\nexamines the divergence in spending growth between low- and high-income\nconsumers.3\nThese are just a few examples of our Consumer Finance Institute’s work.\n2 Robert Kelchen, Dubravka Ritter, and Douglas Webber, “Predicting College Closures and Financial Distress,”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, December 1, 2024, https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-\nfinance/education-finance/predicting-college-closures-and-financial-distress.\n3 Tom Akana, “Evidence of Diverging Spending Behavior by Income,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nNovember 2025, https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/evidence-of-diverging-spending-\nbehavior-by-income.\n3\n\nI would also like to recognize the conference organizing committee as well as give a\nshout-out to all the authors of the fantastic papers that are being featured at the\nconference. There were nearly a hundred very excellent submissions and 11 were\nselected to be included in the conference.\nThe Consumer Finance Institute’s enduring influence after 25 years underscores the\ndedication of all of you as well as the ongoing significance of this work.\nI’d like to thank Roc Armenter, Bob Hunt, and Julia Cheney for their leadership and also\nextend my heartfelt thanks to all of you for attending this conference.\nThe Consumer Finance Institute would not be what it is today without our dedicated\nstaff and decades of collaboration with our academic and industry partners. We are so\ngrateful to have your support, whether you are joining us for the first time or have been\nattending for years.\nWhile I can’t predict the topics that will be discussed at this conference 25 years from\nnow, I am confident that our collective efforts will continue to spark innovation and drive\nimportant policy conversations that will help to make our economy and financial system\nstronger.\nThank you once again for joining us today and tomorrow, and I hope you enjoy the rest\nof the conference. I’ll pass the mic back to Neil now for some quick logistics.\n4",
